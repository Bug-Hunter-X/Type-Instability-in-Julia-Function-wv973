# Type Instability Bug in Julia

This repository demonstrates a common type instability issue in Julia functions. The `myfunction` in `bug.jl` produces unexpected results due to the way Julia handles type inference and dispatch.

The solution in `bugSolution.jl` shows how to fix this issue and demonstrates best practices to avoid type instability issues.
